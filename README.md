# SimpleBar
A simple Bar chart using D3
This is a practice of using D3 to visualize data following [the tutorial by Curran](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jvoTV54nXw&list=PL9yYRbwpkykvjkfuRslECO9c1qTq3GgUb&index=4).
In this practice, we will learn how to draw
+ shapes
> + rectangle(bar)
> + circle(scatter, pie)
> + path(line)

and

+ text
> + axis tag

using a D3 way. That's:
+ use d3 to manipulate DOM instead of using tag to build elements;
+ choose one scale to SET and GET
+ apply "enter-update-exit" model to add and delete shapes to visualize data
